# suppose we want to print 1 to 10 number

# typical way we can use like

# print("1")
# print("2")
# print("3")
# print("4")
# print("5")
# print("6")
# print("7")
# print("8")
# print("9")
# print("10")

# but if we want to print 1000 or more number than we have to write that amount
# print statement

# But this is not sufficient so we can use loop here

# Loop is way to repeat some task over and over

flag = 1

while flag <= 10:
    print(flag)
    flag += 1

# This is how we can use while loop in python
